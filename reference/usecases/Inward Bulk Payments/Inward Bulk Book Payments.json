  "description": "GPP supports message types MT101, MT102, MT102 STP, MT203, and MT204, multiple customer, financial transfer, and direct debit messages. These messages are de-bulked and individual MT103 and MT202 messages are created as per the Sequence B information received. These transactions are processed to Complete after de-bulking and no further user actions are required on these messages. GPP creates a link between multiple messages with its single child messages and can also navigate to them.",
